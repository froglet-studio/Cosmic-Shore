# AI learning: what the last races taught

Written by `Tools/Build/ai_learn.py --run` (the scheduled AI learning sweep, `Docs/AI_SYSTEM/AUTO_LEARNING.md`) on 2026-11-11 22:24 UTC. Nobody runs it by hand: every race flown in Unity reaches it on its own.

**506 new flight(s)** since the last learn.

## What the sweep judged (2026-11-11 22:17 UTC)

- **Jackstraw (Thresher), 1 new race (Garrett), 3 finished in all:** the learner wrote a first
  `ThresherAIBoostPolicy_Jackstraw.asset` (`plantMinTurnDegrees` 70 -> 39.8, `releaseConeDegrees` 15 -> 85, ...).
  **Not committed, and Jackstraw is now report only:** Shombith's `JackstrawHunter` steers every AI Thresher at its rival
  and leaves the plant to the shipped ~70 deg sling (JACKSTRAW.md), while the learner measures plants against the
  nearest crystal. The same holds for **Hood**, Serpent Gulag rebuilt in place (GameModes 77, `SerpentHoodMarksman`): the
  report-only entry now names it too (`REPORT_ONLY_MODES`).
- **Scarab Rally (Scarab), 1 new race (Garrett):** finished; nothing written below 3 finished races.
- Reported only: Brood Rush (Swordfish), Grizzly Time, Kelpwood (Angler).
- The learner's code changed, so every flight was relearned; no policy asset changed and the promoted trained drives
  are untouched (`promote_trained_drives.py --check` OK).

## Waiting on

- **Hood and Jackstraw's AIs (Shombith):** report only while their controllers steer the AI; they learn from races
  only once the learner measures against what the controller steers to.
- **Trained drives against races (Garrett, the AI plan):** when a promoted variant should learn from people again.
- The Breakwater rocket max range (about 679 u, past its 229 u reach) waits on whoever owns the Breakwater rocket.
- A Tiger Moth learner (Tapestry, Waystation, Dustup) is still to build.
