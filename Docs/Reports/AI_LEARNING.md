# AI learning: what the last races taught

Written by `Tools/Build/ai_learn.py --run` (the scheduled AI learning sweep, `Docs/AI_SYSTEM/AUTO_LEARNING.md`) on 2026-10-26 21:23 UTC. Nobody runs it by hand: every race flown in Unity reaches it on its own.

**208 new flight(s)** since the last learn.

- `Docs/AI_SYSTEM/LEARNED_DRIVES_Warpline.md`

## What the sweep judged (2026-10-26 21:21 UTC)

- A learner changed (Regatta is now on HOLD: the AIs train in their own minigames and Regatta is rebuilt from those
  skills later, Yash, 2026-10-27), so every race was relearned. Only `StoatSlingConfig_Warpline` moved, and only
  slightly (slings from 123 u every 0.94 s, released within 16 deg).
- Two races arrived late (a Scurry race of 2026-10-25 and a Skim Race race); neither has AI rivals to judge.
